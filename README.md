# 🚀 Admin Panel – Full-Stack Ecommerce Management System

A **production-ready admin dashboard** built to power modern ecommerce and service-based applications. This panel provides **complete control over products, orders, staff, inventory, banners, discounts, ratings, and notifications**, all secured with **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)** and implemented using **Flutter** for a clean, scalable UI.

This project was built end-to-end with real-world constraints in mind — **not a demo**, not mock data — but a system ready to plug into a live client application.

## 🔐 Security Architecture (RLS)

This project heavily uses **Supabase Row Level Security**:

- Clients can **only insert ratings for their own orders**
- Admin users can **view all data across the system**
- No direct database access from UI widgets
- All reads handled via **service layers**

This ensures:
- ✅ Data isolation  
- ✅ Zero data leakage  
- ✅ Production-grade access control  

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** – Admin UI
- **Supabase** – Backend (Postgres, Auth, RLS)
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database
- **Supabase Storage** – Images & media
- **Supabase Edge Functions** – Notifications & secure backend logic

---

## 📁 Architecture Highlights

- Feature-based folder structure
- Dedicated service classes for database access
- Strong model mapping for relational data
- UI completely decoupled from backend logic

This makes the project:
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to extend
- Easy to reuse for future clients

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Ecommerce admin dashboard
- Food delivery backend panel
- Inventory management system
- Multi-vendor admin control panel
- Starter template for SaaS admin products

---

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

- Real-world database design
- Proper use of foreign keys & constraints
- Secure backend-driven Flutter apps
- Admin UX best practices
- Scalable architecture for production systems

---

## 🚀 Status

✅ **Admin Panel Complete**  
🛠️ Ready for client-side app integration  
📈 Ready for analytics & reporting extensions
